/** Explanation of nth:child

** Syntax: 

** nth:child(an + b) {}

a is the cycle size, meaning it selects elements based on a repeating pattern.
n is the counter that starts at 0 and increments for each subsequent child element.
b is an offset, specifying where the pattern should begin.

you can think of a as a multiplier for n 

When a is 1, the pattern repeats every n elements, selecting every element in the sequence.
When a is 2, the pattern repeats every 2n elements, selecting every other element.
When a is 3, the pattern repeats every 3n elements, selecting every third element, and so on.

-n means it counts backward from the offset (b).

/** Explanation of :nth-last-child()
:nth-last-child selects elements based on their position relative to the end of the parent element.

-n+3 is the formula used to select the last three children:
-n means it counts backward from the last child element.
+3 specifies that it should select up to the third child from the end.
Kinda like "what amount of backwards should i go?"
